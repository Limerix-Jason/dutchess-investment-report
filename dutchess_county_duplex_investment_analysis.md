## Part I: Market Analysis

### Dutchess County Rental Market Overview

Dutchess County represents one of the strongest rental markets in the Hudson Valley region, driven by proximity to New York City (via Metro-North), world-class institutions (Culinary Institute of America, Marist College, Vassar College), and significant tourism (FDR Presidential Library, Walkway Over the Hudson).

#### Key Market Indicators

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **HUD Fair Market Rent (2-BR)** | $1,907/month | HUD 2025 |
| **Vacancy Rate** | ~2% | Market data |
| **Rent Growth (2019-2024)** | +30% | Market analysis |
| **Healthy Vacancy Benchmark** | 5% | Industry standard |

The sub-2% vacancy rate indicates a severely supply-constrained market, creating favorable conditions for landlords and supporting aggressive rental projections.

#### Comparable Rental Rates (Hyde Park Area)

| Property | Type | Rent | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Royal Ledges (4676 Albany Post Rd) | 1 BR | $1,495+ | New construction |
| Royal Ledges (4676 Albany Post Rd) | 2 BR | $1,725+ | New construction |
| Royal Ledges (4676 Albany Post Rd) | 3 BR | $2,275+ | New construction |
| Hudson Place (1 Hudson Dr) | 2 BR | $2,400+ | Professional management |
| 4332 Albany Post Rd #1 | 1 BR | $1,650 | Townhouse unit |
| 6 Fallkill Rd | 1 BR | $1,850 | Apartment |

**Market Rent Projections for Subject Properties:**
- Hyde Park duplex (2 units): $1,700-$1,900/unit = **$3,400-$3,800/month gross**
- Staatsburg duplex (2 units): $1,900-$2,100/unit = **$3,800-$4,200/month gross**

The Staatsburg property commands a premium due to its walkable village location, proximity to state parks, and quieter residential setting.

| Renovation Cost | $240,836 | $241,141 | $481,977 |

## Part V: Return on Investment Projections

### Rental Income Assumptions

| Metric | Hyde Park | Staatsburg |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Units | 2 | 2 |
| Avg Rent/Unit/Month | $1,800 | $2,000 |
| **Monthly Gross Rent** | **$3,600** | **$4,000** |
| **Annual Gross Rent** | **$43,200** | **$48,000** |

### Operating Expense Projection (40% Ratio)

The 40% operating expense ratio includes:
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Maintenance & repairs
- Property management (if applicable)
- Vacancy allowance
- Capital reserves

| Metric | Hyde Park | Staatsburg |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Annual Gross Rent | $43,200 | $48,000 |
| Operating Expenses (40%) | $17,280 | $19,200 |
| **Net Operating Income (NOI)** | **$25,920** | **$28,800** |

### Return Metrics

| Metric | Hyde Park | Staatsburg | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Cap Rate** | 6.1% | 6.3% | NOI / Total Investment |
| **Cash-on-Cash Return** | 6.1% | 6.3% | Assuming all-cash purchase |

Assuming conventional financing at 7.5% interest rate, 30-year amortization:

| Metric | Hyde Park | Staatsburg |

| Total Investment | $426,983 | $459,291 |
| Down Payment (20%) | $85,397 | $91,858 |

| Cash Flow After Debt | -$2,736 | -$2,028 |
| **Cash-on-Cash (Leveraged)** | **-3.2%** | **-2.2%** |

**Warning:** At current interest rates, neither property cash flows positively with 80% leverage. Consider:
- Larger down payment (40-50%)
- Alternative financing (DSCR loans, portfolio lenders)
- Rent increases post-stabilization
- Value-add through unit count increase (quadplex conversion)

---

## Part VI: Quadplex Conversion Analysis (Staatsburg)

### Conversion Rationale

The Staatsburg property's larger footprint (2,584 sq ft) makes it a candidate for conversion from 2 units to 4 units, potentially doubling rental income while staying under the 5-unit threshold that triggers commercial classification.

### Zoning & Regulatory Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Current Zoning Status** | Legal duplex (Class 220) |
| **Target Classification** | 4-unit residential (still Class 220) |
| **Jurisdiction** | Town of Hyde Park Planning & Zoning |
| **Contact** | (845) 229-5111 |
| **Required Action** | Variance or Special Use Permit |
| **Application Fees** | $500 - $2,000 |
| **Approval Timeline** | 3-6 months |

### Building Code Requirements

| Requirement | Specification | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Fire Separation | 2-hour fire-rated walls between units | $8,000 - $15,000 |
| Egress | 2 means of egress per unit | $8,000 - $15,000 |
| Sprinklers | May be required for 4+ units | $15,000 - $25,000 |
| Parking | 1-2 spaces per unit (4-8 total) | $5,000 - $15,000 |
| Separate Utilities | Individual electric/gas meters | $4,000 - $8,000 |
| HVAC | Independent system per unit | $16,000 - $28,000 |
| Soundproofing | Between units | $5,000 - $10,000 |

### Additional Conversion Costs

| Item | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2 Additional Kitchens | $40,000 | $60,000 |
| 2 Additional Bathrooms | $20,000 | $40,000 |
| Fire-Rated Separation Walls | $8,000 | $15,000 |
| Additional Electrical Panels | $4,000 | $8,000 |
| Additional HVAC Systems | $16,000 | $28,000 |
| Additional Entrances/Egress | $8,000 | $15,000 |
| Sprinkler System | $15,000 | $25,000 |
| Soundproofing | $5,000 | $10,000 |
| Zoning/Permits/Architect | $8,000 | $15,000 |
| Parking Expansion | $5,000 | $15,000 |
| **Total Additional Cost** | **$129,000** | **$231,000** |

### Quadplex ROI Comparison

| Scenario | Total Investment | Units | Monthly Rent | Annual NOI | Cap Rate | Payback |
|----------|------------------|-------|--------------|------------|----------|---------|
| Keep as Duplex | $459,291 | 2 | $4,000 | $28,800 | 6.3% | 15.9 yrs |
| Quadplex (Low) | $588,291 | 4 | $7,500 | $54,000 | 9.2% | 10.9 yrs |
| Quadplex (High) | $690,291 | 4 | $7,500 | $54,000 | 7.8% | 12.8 yrs |

**Recommendation:** The quadplex conversion significantly improves returns, with cap rates jumping from 6.3% to 7.8-9.2%. However, this adds considerable complexity, timeline risk, and capital requirements. Pursue if:
- You have experience with value-add multifamily
- You can secure favorable zoning approval early
- You have adequate capital reserves
- Timeline flexibility of 12-18 months

| Tenant Appeal | Moderate | High | Staatsburg |
| Renovation Complexity | High | High | Tie |
| Upside Potential | Limited | Quadplex option | Staatsburg |
| Risk Profile | Higher (road) | Moderate | Staatsburg |

### Recommended Strategy

**Option A: Single Property Focus**
- Acquire Staatsburg property at $195,000-$200,000
- Complete full renovation as duplex
- Stabilize with quality tenants at $4,000+/month
- Evaluate quadplex conversion after 12-24 months of ownership
- Target 10-year hold with refinance at Year 3-5

**Option B: Portfolio Approach**
- Acquire both properties
- Renovate Hyde Park first (lower entry cost, cash flow sooner)
- Use Hyde Park cash flow to fund Staatsburg renovation
- Consider Staatsburg quadplex conversion as Phase 2
- Target combined portfolio value of $1.2M+ post-stabilization

**Option C: Wholesale/Flip**
- Acquire one or both properties
- Complete light renovation (cosmetic only)
- Sell to owner-occupant or other investor
- Target 15-20% gross margin
- Lower return but faster capital recycling

### Final Recommendation

**Pursue Staatsburg property as primary acquisition.** Despite the higher entry price, it offers:
- Superior location in walkable village
- Lower cost per square foot
- Better tenant demographics
- Quadplex conversion upside
- Recent roof replacement reducing near-term capex

Negotiate aggressively given:
- FSBO status (no agent commission to seller)
- Multiple price reductions ($234K → $205K)
- 52+ days on market
- $65,000 purchase in 2018 suggests low basis

**Target Acquisition Price: $185,000-$195,000**
